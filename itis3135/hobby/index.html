                <p>Skiing is a form of transportation that uses skis to glide on snow. Its used for basic transport to recreational acitivity to
                    competitive winter sport. Skiing has a history of almost five millennia. Modern skiing is said to have evoloved from Scandinavia but we can find
                    this style of transportation as far as China. Competitive skiing is recognized by a wide arrange of organization but the biggest organizationto recognized
                    it is the International Olympic Commitee.

                <p>Generally the best times to go skiing in North Carolina are from Thanksgiving and early april, but if
                    your looking for top conditions. Mid-winter between Feburary and mid-March are the best times to
                    catch the
                    best slopes. If you live on the west coast. The best times to skii are nealy the same early January
                    through early March. I highly recommend making sure you prepare at least two months ahead and check
                    you weather condtions to make sure it is safe to travel.

                <p>Skiing can be difficult for beginners, but with the proper eductaion any bigginer can be well off.
                    Thers a few key things to remember when skiing. The first is to make sure you are wearing proper
                    clothing, such as boots, gloves and snow wear that covers all parts of you person. The second
                    important thing to remember is to make sure you always have a skiing partner as it could be
                    dangerous skiing alone. The third thing is to have a map of the slopes so that you don't get lost.
                    And the final key detail is to have fun! </p>

                <p>Skiing has many health benifits, such as it helps burn large amounts of calories making
                    it a great exercise for people looking to loose weight. Another great benifit of skii
                    is that it that it strengthens your lower body muscles. Skiing also is shown to help increase mood
