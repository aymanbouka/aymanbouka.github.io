        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.pennyjuice.com/">Penny Juice</a></h3>
            <p>
                The site I chose as a great example of a bad website is PennyJuice.com. 
                PennyJuice is a website targeting parents of kids. They sell many products, 
                but their most frequently purchased products are their 100% fruit juice. 
                Penny Juice was founded in 2001 and has been in operations ever since. Penny Juice continues on 
                As a tasty popular beverage company.
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                    The issue with the contrast in the website is that some of the colors are
                    too bright making it hard to focus, and read the information.
                    <li>Repition</li>
                    The Penny Juice website doesn't have good repetition, meaning the focus is all over the page, 
                    and isn't clearly defined. 
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                    The Allignment of the Penny Juice website is not great. 
                    One issue is that their are boxes of differnet colors all over the page.
                    Another issue is that these boxes are not in a clear pattern making it 
                    difficult to read.
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                    The proximity of the website is okay, but their could be some improvments on the 
                    Home page. Once these issues are resolved. The website will look much better.
                </ul>
                Here's a few other great examples of good websites:
                <ul><a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway</a></ul>
                <ul><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></ul>
                <ul><a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archives</a></ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple inc</a></h3>
            <p>
                Apple is a hardware and software company, best known for their products such as the
                Iphone, Ipad, Mac, Apple Watch and more. Apple was founded in 1976 in Los Altos, CA.
                Apple is a company that builds much of the high end technology on the marketplace, and is known 
                for producing quality products.
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                    Apple did a great job at creating contrast, with the subtle colors and clear high quality pictures.
                    <li>Repition</li>
                    Apple is one of the best companies, at creating a landing page that has great repition. You can see this in the boxes, and their 
                    placement.
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                    The allignment on apples website, is very good. They made sure that not boxes over lap. This is especially important, so that people are forced to focus on what apple wants.
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                    The proximity on apples website is great. Apple makes sure to group items together based on relevancy. This is
                    especially important for creating a clear and concise website.
                </ul>
                Here's a few other great examples of good websites:
                <ul><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a></ul>
                <ul><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></ul>
